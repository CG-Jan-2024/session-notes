Database
	- uses client / server architecture
	- client here could be a CLI(Command Line Interface) or a GUI(Grphical User Interface) client
	- can use pgAdmin as GUI client for postgres

things a client needs to know to contact the server
---------------------------------------------------
1) network
2) ipaddress of the server
3) port number of the server program
4) protocol
5) credentials (username/password)


server could be
	- web server - http(hyper text transfer protocol)
	- database server
	- file server - ftp (file transfer protocol)

port number
	- generally a 4 digit number
	- tomcat web server - 8080
	- weblogic web server - 7001
	- postgres DB server - 5432
	- angular live development server - 4200
	-

data is stored in the database server - wrong

data is stored by the database server - right


data
	- organized
		- relational DB model
			- tables, rows(records), columns(fields)
			- eg. postgres, mysql, oracle
		- no sql model
			- eg. mongoDB
	- manipulate
		- adding, deleting, modifying

SQL - Structured Querying Language

ANSII SQL - this a standard/specification proposed for SQL

most DB softwares follow this ANSII SQL

Postgres

Like all Languages , SQL is also compiled and executed

steps in executing a query
--------------------------
1) we type the query in the client program
2) once enter is pressed, the query is sent to the server
3) the server takes the request(query), processes the query(compiles and executes) the query
4) the server sends the reponse(output of the query) to the client
5) we see the output of the query on the client

SQL categories
--------------
1) DDL - Data Definition Language
		- here queries are related to the structure of the table
			- CREATE, ALTER, DROP
2) DML - Data Manipulation Language
		- here queries are related to the data in the table
			- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
3) DQL - Data Querying Language
		- to fetch data
			- SELECT
				- where, joins, group by, having
4) DCL - Data Control Language
		- GRANT, REVOKE
5) TCL - Transaction Control Language
		- COMIT, ROLLBACK

Normalization
Transaction - ACID properties
Constraints - Primary key, foreign key, unique, not null etc
