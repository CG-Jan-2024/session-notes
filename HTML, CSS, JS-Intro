Web Designing
-------------
web server - 
	- a program
	- should be up and running
	- can take in a request, process it and send a response
	- can host a web application (copying the web application files into the server )

web application - 
	- collection of web pages

web pages - 
	- user interface/ displays information/ get input from the user
	- 2 types of web pages
		- static web pages 
			- contents will never change on the server side
			- the page is sent as it is

		- dynamic web pages
			- has some program in it, which executes at the server side and changes the content of the page


HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
----------------------------------
	- used to create web pages
	- it is a markup language - a language which is full of tags - start tag, end tag, text, attribute name and attribute value
	- we will use html 5 version - the start the file should have doctype
	- many new things were introduced in html5 (know this)
		- semantic tags - header, footer, section, nav, main 
		- more input types were added - <input type="eemail"> - email, date, number etc
		- audio and video tags were introduced

	- sample html

	<html>
		<head>
			<title>My First Page <html>

		</head>
		<body>
			<h2 font="red"> My First web page using HTML</h2>
		</body>
	</html>

	- use VSCode, notepad for html and save the file with .html extension. open the file in a browser. here we are not using a server.



CSS - Cascading Stylesheet
---------------------------
	- used to style your web pages
	- the css styles reside in your html page
	- how to include css in html, the css selectors, the css properties, box model, short hand notation
	- background, margin, border, text, padding, colors, etc


Javascript
----------
	- is a scripting language
	- a scripting language is a light weight programming language
	- javascript and java are not the same
	- javascript code resides on the webpage and when the client asks for the page the JS code is sent along with the webpage
	- the JS code reaches the browser(client) and it is executed on the client side
	- so JS is called a client side scripting language
	- who executes your JS code? - browser (the browser provides the runtime environment for JS)
	- can the browser alone provide the runtime environment for JS? not necessary. NodeJs can also provide the environment to run JS.
	- server side programs - servlets & JSP(Java Server Pages)	

	- things to learn in JS
		- variables, operators, functions, control statememnt, looping statements, input, output
		- know the ES6 features added to JS

	- in JS we dont declare variables using datatypes. we use var, let, const to declare variables in JS.
		var mark1 = 50;
		var isCorrect = true;
		var subjectName = "English";

		var isCorrect = false; // no error - in JS we can redeclare a variable 

		var mark1 = "Math"; // no error - in JS you can change the type of data stored in a variable
		for this reason we say JS is not strongly typed

		let and const was introduced in ES6 - definetly learn it
