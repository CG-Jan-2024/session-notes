Web Designing
-------------
web server - 
	- a program
	- should be up and running
	- can take in a request, process it and send a response
	- can host a web application (copying the web application files into the server )

web application - 
	- collection of web pages

web pages - 
	- user interface/ displays information/ get input from the user
	- 2 types of web pages
		- static web pages 
			- contents will never change on the server side
			- the page is sent as it is

		- dynamic web pages
			- has some program in it, which executes at the server side and changes the content of the page


HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
----------------------------------
	- used to create web pages
	- it is a markup language - a language which is full of tags - start tag, end tag, text, attribute name and attribute value
	- we will use html 5 version - the start the file should have doctype
	- many new things were introduced in html5 (know this)
		- semantic tags - header, footer, section, nav, main 
		- more input types were added - <input type="eemail"> - email, date, number etc
		- audio and video tags were introduced

	- sample html

	<html>
		<head>
			<title>My First Page <html>

		</head>
		<body>
			<h2> My First web page using HTML</h2>
		</body>
	</html>

	- use VSCode, notepad for html and save the file with .html extension. open the file in a browser. here we are not using a server.
