C - structured programming language
  - has concept of pointers
  - used to create system programs

C++ - object oriented programing language
     - is it pure object oriented? - no

Java 
	- programming language
	- object oriented programming language
	- syntax from c + oops concept for c++(modified)
	- is java pure object oriented programing language - no
	- james gosling is the founder of java
	- complete reference book

IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)
	- Eclipse, Netbeans, intellij, vscode

JRE - Java Runtime Environment
JDK - Java  Devleopment Kit
    - JRE + Java compiler
JVM - Java Virtual Machine
    - converts byte code to machine code
    - a part of the JRE

First.java ---compile----> First.class ----run--->machine code & output
(source)                   (byte code)           (java does not retain the machine code)

always keep the code neat and aligned

Naming conventions to be strictly followed
class name - title casing
		- eg: HelloWorld, BankAccount
variables - camel cased
		- eg: englishMark, total, isCompleted
methods - camel casing
		- eg: computeTotal(), findLowestMark()

Data types
	- primitive data types
	- non-primitive/ derived data types
		- classes, Interfaces, arrays

8 primitive data types
-----------------------
	- byte
	- short
	- int
	- long
	- float
	- double
	- boolean
	- char

int mark = 50;
we are storing a int literal in a int variable
char ch = 'd';
boolean flag = true; // in java boolean variables hold only true or false

in c
----
	boolean fl = 0; // not possible in java
